### Migrate to Growth Push

> [Growth Push](http://en.growthpush.com/) is one of the biggest push notification platoform in Japan. Growth Push provides Push Notification's analyses and delivery services for Applications developers. - [relatedcode/ParseAlternatives](https://github.com/relatedcode/ParseAlternatives)

**For Growth push, the script will generate CSV files which are named `ios.csv` and `android.csv`**. You can use it on Growth Push dashbord. They also provide [API](http://ja.growthpush.com/documents#restClientsApi) to import but it will take much time so I choose the way. If you would like to import yours with API, please create a [issue](https://github.com/sotayamashita/parse-migration-tool/issues/new?title=Growth%20Push%20-%20I%20would%20like%20to%20import%20device%20token%20with%20API).

```bash
$ parse migrate -s growthpush credential.json
$ ls
ios.csv andorid.csv
```
